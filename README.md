    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name  
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'  
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'     
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL   
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
